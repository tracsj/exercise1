    "* What states are models of high-quality care?\n",
    "* Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?\n",
    "* Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?\n"

    "The measures of timely and effective care report the percentage of hospital patients who receive the treatments that are known to get the best results for certain common, serious medical conditions or surgical procedures; how quickly hospitals treat patients who come to the hospital with certain medical emergencies; and how well hospitals provide preventive services. These measures only apply to patients for whom the recommended treatment would be appropriate. The measures of timely and effective care apply to adults and children treated at hospitals paid under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) or the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), as well as those that voluntarily report data on measures for whom the recommended treatments would be appropriate including: Medicare patients, Medicare managed care patients, and non-Medicare patients. Timely and effective care measures are also referred to as process of care measures and include acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP), emergency department, preventive care, children’s asthma\n",

    "The 30-day unplanned readmission measures are estimates of unplanned readmission to any acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge from a hospitalization for any cause related to medical conditions, including heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and stroke; and surgical procedures, including hip/knee replacement and cornary artery bypass graft (CABG). The 30-day unplanned hospital-wide readmission measure focuses on whether patients who were discharged from a hospitalization were hospitalized again within 30 days. The hospital-wide readmission measure includes all medical, surgical and gynecological, neurological, cardiovascular, and cardiorespiratory patients. The 30-day death measures are estimates of deaths within 30-days of a hospital admission from any cause related to medical conditions, including heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, COPD, and stroke; and surgical procedures, including CABG. Hospitals’ rates are compared to the national rate to determine if hospitals’ performance on these measures is better than the national rate (lower), no different than the national rate, or worse than the national rate (higher). For some hospitals, the number of cases is too small to reliably compare their results to the national average rate. Rates are provided in the downloadable databases as decimals and typically indicate information that is presented\n",
