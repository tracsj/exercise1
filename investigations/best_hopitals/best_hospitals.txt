I decided to use Avg as the best measure of quality of care across procedures as it's a well accepted measure of central tendency. I noticed that the effectiveness and readmissions scores data had very different levels, so it made sense to chose one to look at so in this case we're looking at the average effectiveness scores.

 Therefore on an average score basis FALLS COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND CLINIC is the hospital with the highest average quality of care. Given FCHAC has 13 number of procedures this is a reasonable sample to say that its high average score is a reflection of consistently excellent procedures. Some of the other top 10 have only a small number of procedures e.g. Bear Valley with 3. Therefore I am going to impose a minimum of at least 5 procedures to be considered for the top 10. The result is as follows:
