I took the average score for every procedure across every hospital. I then took the Min and Max for each procedure across all hospitals and computed the range. This gives us a measure of 'how variable' a score is between hospitasl.

 The result is we see that "Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients" and "Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients" are by far the most variable measures. Clearly there is a large degree of variability in hospitals dealing with patients in a timely fashion!
